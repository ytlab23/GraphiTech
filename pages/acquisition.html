                        <h3>3D Laser Scanner</h3>
                        <p>The Escan is accurate to 150 microns and its scan is completed very quickly - a mere 7 seconds. The Escan offers professional functionality and reverse engineering capabilities.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Escan is not limited by the size of the object to be scanned due to its portability. The Escan can start scanning right out of the box with minimal setup. Unlike its competitors, the Escan does not require timely setup nor the placement of markers to merge a scan for multiple view points. The software will do that, and a lot more for you.</p>

                        <h3>Full-HD Video Camcorder with Slow Motion</h3>
                        <p>The JVC Everio GZ-HM400 features a 10.3-megapixel CMOS sensor and 3 slow-motion options in addition to Full HD 1080/50i recording.</p><br>
                        <p>The JVC GZ-HM400 shoots 1920 x 1080 Full HD AVCHD format at 60 frames per second. In UXP video recording mode, it records at 24Mbps, the highest bit rate currently available for AVCHD video systems. It features superior optical video stabilization to reduce the effects of movement and camera shake and has a built-in filming light and flash. It features a low lux/night shooting mode, face detection and multiple simple methods for transferring recorded content including one button transfer and an HDMI connector.</p><br>
                        <p>The JVC GZ-HM400 has 32GB of built-in flash memory which is faster and more reliable than other recording media, such as DVDs or hard drives in that there are no moving parts. The camera will also accommodate an additional SD/SDHC memory card up to 32GB, effectively doubling the storage size.</p><br>

                        <h3>3D Full-HD Video Camcorder</h3>
                        <p>The HDC-S900 is one of the best-ever Panasonic video camcorders.</p><br>
                        <p>The 3MOS System colorfully renders 2D and 3D images and has 7.59 million effective motion image pixels (2.53 megapixels x 3). This sensor separates the light received through the lens into the three primary colors—red, green, and blue—and processes each color independently, offering images with significantly better color quality, detail, and gradation than a 1MOS sensor system.</p><br>
                        <p>1,080/50p recording (full-HD, 1,920 x 1,080, 50 progressive recording) at a 28-Mbps bit rate conveys about twice the information of 1,080i (interlace) recording, producing the ultimate in image quality, exceeding even conventional full-HD images. It minimizes afterimages and flickering caused by subject motion and renders crisp, detailed images.</p><br>
                        <p>By attaching the 3D Conversion Lens (VW-CLT1) to the camcorder, it is possible to record 3D images in AVCHD format firsthand. Incorporating Panasonic's 3MOS technology, users can easily create their own 3D movies with extreme realism. The AVCHD format enables playback using a Panasonic VIERA TV and Blu-ray Disc™ player/recorder. A TV capable of side-by-side method 3D playback, 3D eyewear, and an HDMI cable connection are required.</p><br>
